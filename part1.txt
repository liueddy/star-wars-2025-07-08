Given lines 13-25 in the generate_data.py file,
which side a character chooses looks directly 
linked to the rebel_likelihood field in 
home_worlds.json.

Additionally, because every other parameter
besides home_worlds is randomly generated 
without due regard for what "side" a given
character is on, it is almost certainly
the case that these features will not 
be important.  I fully expect these 
features have weights nearly zero.

If these weights are high, it's likely
the model is overfit and will perform
poorly on test data.
