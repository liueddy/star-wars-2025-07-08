Given the nature of the project--with parts two and three dependant on part one--we found it imperitive that part one be handled first.  
Using this method, we would be able to tackle parts two and three concurrently. 

We also found it imperitive to work in different files such that we would not adversely interfere with one another or produce merge conflicts.

As such, the plan is:

Tuesday afternoon:
- Part 1 - Eddy

Wednesday Morning
- Part 2 - Archit
- Part 3 - Kalid
- Bonus? - Eddy
